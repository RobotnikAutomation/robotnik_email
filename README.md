## SMTP Configuration

In order to use this package a SMTP server is required. There are two modes of use:

- Working with a SMTP provided by a third party. For example, a customer or a company.

- Working with your own SMTP, for testing purposes only.

### a) SMTP Third Party

The customer has to give us acces to work with his SMTP. You have ask for ```user```, ```password```, ```from email```, ```SMTP server``` and ```port```. In this example credentials are not needed:

```
User: ---
Password: --- 
From email:  name@company.com
SMTP server: 10.100.100.10
Port: 25
```

### b) SMTP on your own

This is the recommended way to familiarize yourself with this package.

Use a google account without double verification and watch this video to configure your own SMTP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5Dex4m40w

At the end of the video you will be able to fill all the fields. This is an example:

```
User: username@gmail.com
Password: yourpassword 
From email:  username@gmail.com
SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com
Port: 587
```

Additionally, you can test if your SMTP server is working properly by sending an email through the following link. Select ```Tls``` as securty field: https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test


## Package configuration

This package needs the SMTP server information to send emails. So that, edit the following file:

```

  password: 'yourpassword'
  sender: 'username@gmail.com'
  default_recipients:
    - 'recipient1@domain.com'

```
